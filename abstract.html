EDUCATIONAL WEBSITES like EDX, FUNBRAIN, DUOLINGO, COURSERA, PBS KIDS, KHAN
ACADEMY, BRAINSCAPE, SCHOLASTIC ETC……, Also this survey helps to keep impact on how
people utilize the education websites and how they used to get more knowledge using Educational Websites

potential for social isolation, limited ability to assess practical skills, increased risk of distractions, self
discipline. By doing survey on the educational website, we can get more information on how people are
