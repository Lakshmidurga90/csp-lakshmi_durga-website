       We conducted a survey in our area to understand how many people are using educational websites. Based on the results, we found that only a few people are using educational websites, while the majority are not. Our findings also revealed that some users face issues while using these platforms. However, those who do use educational websites report several benefits. The survey further explored the advantages users gain and the quality of content they receive from educational websites.</p></section>
